# position-estimation-of-human-body-parts
All the body parts of human body be monitored using Computer Vision. This is a mini project of mine where I used Opencv pose and mediapie, to estimate the position of each body part of a human body and track it.

# How to Implement it at your own syatem

* Firstly download Anaconda for windows and then install it, and go to anaconda navigator to check if there is pycharm installed inside the Anaconda navigartor
* Then make a prject folder inside your system storage, where you'll download the zip file of this repository
* Then open anaconda promt and go to that project file and give the command "pycharm"
* Pycharm will open, where you create new project inside that file, It will create the python environment inside that folder.
* Then download any video from the internet and save it in the project file. Or you can use the demo video in the repo as well.
* Then you open the posemodule.py file in pycharm and install libraries given in the code
* Edit the name of your video file in place of video.mp4 in the code
* run the program and see the output.
* If you want to see the basic structure of the program, open jupyter lab from anaconda promt inside your project file.
* Over there examine the code of and the logic of the program in pose_estimation.ipynb.
* For any queries or issues mention it in the issue section of the repository.
